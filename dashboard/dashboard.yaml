# Create a service for the Kubernetes Dashboard that I can control and publish
#   through nginx.
# Has to be put into the kube-system namespace, or else it can't find the pods
#   it needs to serve.
# Typical solutions include having an ExternalName service, but that doesn't
#   let me expose an IP address, and proxy via nginx without using the ingress
#   system.
