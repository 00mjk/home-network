# Home network configuration templates

This repo holds configurations for my home network.
It includes docker images, or host-modifying make commands that will allow any machine to be turned into a home network host without needing to configure much else.

*Note* There's still a lot of "much else", but every time something new is done, the hope if that the gap of "much else" closes.

# Major ToDos

- [ ] Properly create users that can cross the VM boundary with OS X/Windows where possible. 
- [ ] Get the Makefile set up so it can properly invalidate autogenerated files when the sources change.
- [ ] Make sure that all Dockerfiles have the appropriate number of layers. There are a lot that run simple commands back to back in different layers, wasting time + space.
- [ ] Get the whole thing configured to work with Docker Swarm, so it can be run on an array of hosts, rather than just one.
- [ ] Get health checks set up on the containers where a health check makes sense (probably all of them.)
- [ ] Figure out a more sustainable way of managing backups/crons.
