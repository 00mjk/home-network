# Home network configuration templates

**Note** In interest of brevity, where not otherwise explicitly stated, this readme should be read as though it strictly focuses on running on Linux.

This repo holds configurations for my home network.
It includes docker images, or host-modifying make commands that will allow any machine to be turned into a home network host without needing to configure much else.

*Note:* There's still a lot of "much else", but every time something new is done, the hope if that the gap of "much else" closes.

# Volumes/Mounts

This project involves keeping a lot of docker containers running, and ensuring that their contents are appropriately organized so that they can be backed up.
The project currently doesn't have an especially functional method of managing volumes, or their backups, especially across containers or shares.
See the todos for volumes and backups for a little more on that.

In order for docker and network shares to behave nicely, and still follow some reasonable conventions, network shares are mounted to `/mnt` on the host machine, and symlinked to a more appropriate place on the host.
They're then mounted to containers, usually in the same place as on the host.

This system assumes there is a centralized storage server that all network shares are hosted from.
Other options may be considered in the future if need be.

## Network Shares

Network shares are divided out into groupings of services.
Individual directories within the mount points can be symlinked as needed.

| Name          | Network Mount      | Mount Point      |
| ============= | ================== | ================ |
| Backups       | `/share/backups`   | `/mnt/backups`   |
| Databases     | `/share/db`        | `/mnt/db`        |
| Downloads     | `/share/downloads` | `/mnt/downloads` |
| Other Storage | `/share/storage`   | `/mnt/storage`   |

## Host Symlinks

The host machines will add the symlinks they need to the directories within their mounts that they need to access resources.

| Mount Path                      | Host Path                   | Description
| =============================== | =========================== | =============
| `/mnt/backups`                  | `/var/lib/backups`          | All backups from any containers.
| `/mnt/db/mysql`                 | `/var/lib/mysql`            | MySQL storage.
| `/mnt/db/mongodb`               | `/var/lib/mongodb`          | MongoDB storage.
| `/mnt/downloads/oss`            | `/var/lib/downloads/oss`    | Open source software downloads.
| `/mnt/storage/sharelatex`       | `/var/lib/sharelatex`       | ShareLaTeX files not included in DB.
| `/mnt/storage/resliosync`       | `/var/lib/.sync`            | Reslio Sync metadata.
| `/mnt/storage/plex`             | `/var/lib/plex`             | Plex metadata.
| `/mnt/storage/transmission-oss` | `/var/lib/transmission-oss` | Transmission metadata for open source software.
| `/mnt/storage/git`              | `/var/lib/git`              | Git repositories.

## Container Mounts

Each container may mount host paths wherever they need to.
These are documented here so that they can be grokked easily.

| Host Path                   | Container          | Container Path
| =========================== | ================== | ==========================
| `/var/lib/backups`          | `util`             | `/var/lib/backups`
| `/var/lib/backups`          | `resilio-server`   | `/var/lib/resilio-folders`
| `/var/lib/mysql`            | `mysql`            | `/var/lib/data`
| `/var/lib/mongodb`          | `mongodb`          | `/data/db`
| `/var/lib/downloads/oss`    | `transmission-oss` | `/var/lib/downloads`
| `/var/lib/sharelatex`       | `sharelatex`       | `/var/lib/sharelatex`
| `/var/lib/.sync`            | `resilio-sync`     | `/.sync`
| `/var/lib/plex`             | `plex`             | `/config`
| `/var/lib/transmission-oss` | `transmission-oss` | `/var/lib/transmission`
| `/var/lib/git`              | `util`             | `/var/lib/git`


# Major ToDos

- [ ] Properly create users that can cross the VM boundary with OS X/Windows where possible. 
- [ ] Get the Makefile set up so it can properly invalidate autogenerated files when the sources change.
- [ ] Make sure that all Dockerfiles have the appropriate number of layers. There are a lot that run simple commands back to back in different layers, wasting time + space.
- [ ] Get the whole thing configured to work with Docker Swarm, so it can be run on an array of hosts, rather than just one.
- [ ] Get health checks set up on the containers where a health check makes sense (probably all of them.)
- [ ] Figure out a more sustainable way of managing backups/crons.
- [ ] Volume mounting logic may be a little platform specific and needs help.
